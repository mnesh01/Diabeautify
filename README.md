## Diabeautify
A machine learning-based diabetes prediction system built using Python and Streamlit. It allows users to input various health parameters and predicts the likelihood of having diabetes using a Random Forest Classifier.

## Features
User-friendly Streamlit UI for patient data input.
Predicts diabetes based on user health metrics.
Provides statistical insights and visualizations.
Utilizes Random Forest Classifier for predictions.
Displays accuracy score of the model.

## Installation
To run the project, install the required dependencies:
pip install streamlit
